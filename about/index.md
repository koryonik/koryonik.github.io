## About me.

I am full stack developer at Prolipsia, a french company developing linguistics-based 
proofreading software. I have been influenced by a Java academic background, and a few years as web developer with PHP & JavaScript frameworks. 

Today, I’m playing with Symfony2, AngularJS, C# or even Prolog. I’m also interesting by Continuous Improvement,  Software quality, Agile methodologies, DevOps and even UI Design.

## About blog.

I have no really free time to write full articles, but I decided to start my own blog to centralize my technical notes, tips, experimentations and share them with you.

*If you found a typo, you can fork the repo and edit posts. Thank you :)*

Blog is powered by Jekyll and hosted on GitHub.
